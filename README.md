## Introduction

{big statement} Decentralizing scientific peer review has become an imperative of our modern age. 

The current peer review process has rightfully come under fire by a growing number of scientists and researchers claiming to be disenfranchised and unable to publish in their field's peer review journals (ref). 

We propose to use best-of-breed blockchain technologies, open source software, and decentralized governance systems to remove barriers of entry to scientific publishing and review. Our solutions will be designed to remain resilient to future attempts to control publishing and critiquing of scientific content. 

A large part of today's problems is rooted in misaligned financial incentives and lack of market forces to direct pricing of services. Blockchain technology can be used to design a network of scientific collaboration that can provide services to disenfranchised researchers like the Medical Freedom community (ref). 

Note that the use and offering of "open source software" does not prevent commercial for-profit activities, we simply mean software services provided by systems published under OSS licenses. OSS is the software development's version of peer-review. Most significant software companies use and provide OSS software. 

A (currently unformed) commercial operator and code-base maintainer is needed to ensure sustainability of the solutions and networks proposed in this paper. [Appendix B](commercial.md) provides a suite of commercial paid-for offerings that would generate multiple revenue streams. Full business cases and sizing assessment for these opportunities is beyond the scope of this paper.


The paper is divided in the sections below: 

### [Section 1: Defining the Problems](problems.md)

In this document, we will identify *some* of the problems in the current peer-review model so as to ensure we propose a valuable and differentiated solution for a specific target market. As the project progresses, we will also later trace each of our system requirements to these real-world problems so our code can be more easily understood and reviewed by the global community of OSS developers. 

Full critical analysis of the peer-review process is left of other more qualified philosophers and commentators. This document will provide hopefully enough references to convince the critical reader that there are multiple problems with the current scientific peer review process, and that these problems can be solved today with maturing blockchain and web3 governance technologies.
